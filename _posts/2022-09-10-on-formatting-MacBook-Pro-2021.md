##On Formatting MacBook Pro 2021
sometimes you need to wipe your slate clean and start over. or format your MacBook  and start over. because you installed apps that you didn't need and then when you uninstalled them, there were files leftover and you made a mess deleting those leftover files. so you needed to format your MacBook. anyway, here's how to do it:
- long press the power button. do not let up until you see 'Loading startup options'
- you'll then see 'Macintosh HD' and 'Options'. select 'Options'. 
- you'll then be presented with 'macOS Recovery' screen. here you'll be able to select from a number of options, 'Restoring from Time Machine', 'Reinstall macOS Monterey', 'Safari' and 'Disk Utility'. select whichever is desired.

you're welcome!
